# Battleships

In my first semester of university, I made a Battleships game.

## Features
- Command-line interface
- Customizable board size (N x N)
- Player vs. Player gameplay
- Simple hit/miss mechanics

## How to Play
1. Player 1 sets up the board with 'x' and 'o' characters.
2. Player 2 guesses the positions of the 'x'-s.
3. The game continues until all targets are found.

## Compilation & Execution
To compile and run the game, use:
```sh
cd torpedo
gcc main.c -o battleships
./battleships
```
